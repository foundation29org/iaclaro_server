    "genetic_technique": {
      "WGS": "During the analysis, we used a technique called Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). This comprehensive method allows us to read all the genetic material (DNA) in your cells, providing a detailed view of your unique genetic makeup. Think of it as reading every word in the instruction manual for building and maintaining your body. By using WGS, we can gather valuable insights into your health and potential genetic influences.",
      "Exome": "For your analysis, we employed a method known as Exome Sequencing. This targeted approach focuses on the parts of your DNA that contain instructions for making proteins, which are essential building blocks in your body. Although the exome makes up only a small portion of your total DNA, it's where most disease-causing genetic changes are found. By concentrating on this critical region, we can efficiently identify potential genetic factors that may impact your health.",
      "Panel": "In your case, we utilized a Gene Panel to analyze your DNA. This specialized technique allows us to examine a specific set of genes that are known to be related to the health condition in question. You can think of it as reading only the chapters of the instruction manual that are relevant to a particular topic. By focusing on these key genes, we can gather targeted information to help guide your healthcare decisions and management strategies."

    "genetic_heritage": {
      "autosomalDominant": "Based on your results, the genetic change identified follows an Autosomal Dominant pattern of inheritance. This means that you only need one copy of the altered gene to have the related trait or condition. If you have an autosomal dominant condition, each of your children has a 50% chance of inheriting it from you. Some well-known examples of conditions that follow this pattern include Huntington's disease and achondroplasia.",
      "autosomalRecessive": "Your genetic testing indicates an Autosomal Recessive pattern of inheritance. In this case, you need two copies of the altered gene, one from each parent, to have the related condition. If both parents are carriers of the recessive gene change, each child has a 25% chance of being affected. Common examples of autosomal recessive conditions include cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease.",
      "XLinkedDominant": "The results of your genetic analysis suggest an X-Linked Dominant pattern of inheritance. Gene changes on the X chromosome can lead to X-linked conditions, which affect males and females differently. Females need only one copy of the altered gene to be affected, while males, who have only one X chromosome, need just one copy to show the condition. Rett syndrome is an example of an X-linked dominant condition.",
      "XLinkedRecessive": "Based on your genetic profile, the inheritance pattern appears to be X-Linked Recessive. In this case, females with one copy of an X-linked recessive gene change are usually unaffected carriers. However, males with one copy of the altered gene are typically affected. Affected fathers pass the gene change to all their daughters but none of their sons. Well-known examples of X-linked recessive conditions include hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",
      "mitochondrial": "Your genetic testing points to a Mitochondrial pattern of inheritance. Mitochondria are structures within cells that produce energy, and they contain their own DNA. Changes in mitochondrial DNA are passed exclusively from mother to child. Both males and females can be affected by mitochondrial conditions, but only females have the potential to pass the altered DNA to their children. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is an example of a condition with mitochondrial inheritance.",
      "YLinked": "The genetic change identified in your results follows a Y-Linked pattern of inheritance. Gene changes on the Y chromosome are passed directly from father to son. Only males are affected by Y-linked conditions, and they will pass the altered gene to all their sons. An example of a rare Y-linked condition is one that causes extra hair growth in the ears."

    "pathogenic_variants": {
      "true": "During the analysis of your genetic material, we identified changes in your DNA that are known to be Pathogenic Variants. These alterations have been previously associated with specific health issues. However, it's important to note that having a pathogenic variant doesn't necessarily mean you will develop the related condition, as other genetic and environmental factors can influence the outcome. Your healthcare provider will work with you to assess your individual risks and discuss appropriate management strategies.",
      "false": "After thorough analysis, we did not identify any Pathogenic Variants in your genetic testing results. This means that the genetic changes found in your DNA are not currently known to cause health problems. However, it's essential to understand that this does not completely rule out the possibility of a genetic condition, as there may be changes that current testing methods cannot detect. Your healthcare team will consider these results along with your personal and family health history to provide you with the most accurate risk assessment and care recommendations."
    },
    "paternal_tests_confirmation": {
      "true": "Considering the genetic changes found in your DNA, we recommend proceeding with Parental Testing. By analyzing your parents' genetic material, we can determine whether the variations identified in your results were inherited or if they arose spontaneously. This additional information can provide valuable insights into the potential health risks for you and your family members. Your healthcare provider can guide you through the process of parental testing and help you understand the implications of the results.",
      "false": "Based on the analysis of your genetic testing results, Parental Testing is not necessary at this time. The genetic changes found in your DNA do not currently warrant further investigation in your parents. However, your healthcare provider may still recommend other genetic tests or evaluations based on your individual health history and family background. They will work with you to determine the most appropriate course of action to safeguard your health and well-being."
